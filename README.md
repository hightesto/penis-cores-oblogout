Penis-cores oblogout

theme for oblogout made with paint in less than 10 minutes

inspired by adeos-cores by bruhensant

the name is not meant to make fun on adeos-cores, rather I didn't come up with a good name

why is this so low quality you might ask?

~~because I like the Minecraft style~~ because I'm too lazy to make this in high quality
