# penis-cores oblogout ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beab7b2d-4312-442a-add8-3c56448e5500)

theme for oblogout made with paint in less than 10 minutes

heavily inspired by [bruhensant/Adeos-Cores](https://github.com/bruhensant/Adeos-Oblogout)

**the name is not meant to make fun on adeos-cores, rather I didn't come up with a good name**

why is this so low quality you might ask?

~~because I like the Minecraft style~~ because I'm too lazy to make this in high quality

yes the hibernate moon looks kinda awful
